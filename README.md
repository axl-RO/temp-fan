This embedded system project uses an Arduino Uno with a DHT11 temperature sensor and a DC fan to automatically control cooling based on room temperature.

-If the temperature is below 30°C, the fan remains OFF, and the LED stays OFF.

-If the temperature is 30°C or higher, the fan is activated, and the LED turns ON.

-The code uses the DHT library to read temperature values and basic digital I/O control for the fan and LED.
